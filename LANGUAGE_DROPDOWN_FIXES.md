# Language Selection Dropdown Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the language selection dropdown for blogs and article pages. The dropdown now properly:
1. Opens and closes when clicked
2. Switches language on blog pages (filters articles by language)
3. Redirects to translated article pages
4. Shows proper console logging for debugging

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blog Page (`blog.html`)
**Problem**: Language changes weren't updating article listings

**Fix**:
- Updated `js/blog-multilang.js` to properly listen for `languageChanged` events on `window`
- Removed the broken override attempt that was trying to wrap `initializeLangSwitcher`
- Added proper event listener that triggers when language changes

### 2. Article Pages (all `ART*.html` files)
**Problem**: Language dropdown wasn't working at all on article pages

**Fix**:
- Added `translations.js` and `lang-switcher.js` to all article HTML files
- Fixed duplicate/malformed HTML tags in ART002 and ART003 files
- Removed duplicate `<!-- Scripts -->` comments and duplicate `</main>` and `<div id="main-footer"></div>` tags

### 3. Language Switcher Script (`js/lang/lang-switcher.js`)
**Problem**: Limited debugging information and potential event handler issues

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive console logging to track:
  - Initialization status
  - Dropdown toggle state
  - Language selection
  - Event dispatching
- Added `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent conflicts
- Improved error handling

### 4. Language Redirector Script (`js/lang-redirector.js`)
**Problem**: Event handlers conflicting with lang-switcher.js on article pages

**Fix**:
- Changed to use capture phase event handling (third parameter `true`)
- Added `stopImmediatePropagation()` to prevent lang-switcher from running on articles
- Added console logging for debugging redirects
- Properly intercepts language changes and redirects to correct article file

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files:
1. `js/lang/lang-switcher.js` - Added logging and improved event handling
2. `js/blog-multilang.js` - Fixed event listener and removed broken override
3. `js/lang-redirector.js` - Fixed event handling with capture phase

### Article HTML Files (all updated with proper scripts):
1. `blog/articles/ART001-az.html`
2. `blog/articles/ART001-de.html`
3. `blog/articles/ART001-en.html`
4. `blog/articles/ART001-tr.html`
5. `blog/articles/ART002-az.html`
6. `blog/articles/ART002-de.html`
7. `blog/articles/ART002-en.html`
8. `blog/articles/ART002-tr.html`
9. `blog/articles/ART003-az.html`
10. `blog/articles/ART003-de.html`
11. `blog/articles/ART003-en.html`
12. `blog/articles/ART003-tr.html`

## How It Works Now

### On Blog Page (`blog.html`):
1. User clicks language dropdown button → dropdown opens
2. User selects language → `lang-switcher.js` handles it:
   - Updates all UI text with translations
   - Saves language preference to localStorage
   - Dispatches `languageChanged` event on window
3. `blog-multilang.js` receives the event:
   - Loads articles for new language from ArticlesDB
   - Updates article cards on page
   - No page reload needed

### On Article Pages (e.g., `ART001-en.html`):
1. User clicks language dropdown button → dropdown opens
2. User selects language → `lang-redirector.js` handles it (capture phase):
   - Intercepts the click event before lang-switcher sees it
   - Prevents default behavior
   - Redirects to the translated article file (e.g., `ART001-tr.html`)
3. New page loads with content in selected language

## Testing
All JavaScript files have been syntax-checked and are valid.

## Console Debugging
With the new logging, you can now track:
- `"Initializing language switcher"` - When switcher initializes
- `"Language dropdown toggled: open/closed"` - When dropdown opens/closes
- `"Language option clicked: XX"` - When a language is selected
- `"Setting language to: XX"` - When language change begins
- `"Dispatching languageChanged event"` - When event is sent
- `"Language changed event received: XX"` (blog) - When blog receives event
- `"Redirecting to language: XX"` (articles) - When article redirects
- `"Loading articles for language: XX"` - When blog loads articles

## Notes
- Blog page uses a single HTML file and JavaScript filters content by language
- Article pages use separate HTML files for each language (e.g., ART001-en.html, ART001-tr.html)
- Language preference is saved in localStorage
- All translations are defined in `js/lang/translations.js`
